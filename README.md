### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* **Node.js**
* Text editor to write out Node scripts such as **Visual Studio Code**
* **MongoDB** database

**Links:**
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - recommended ***version 12.8.1*** or greater
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - recommended ***version 1.44*** or greater

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

**Clone**
* Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/dominikaduda/movie-info-api.git`

**Setup**
> In the project directory, install required npm modules by running from the terminal:

```
npm install
```

> In the project directory, create ***config*** directory.

>Next up, create an environment file ***dev.env*** in the ***config*** directory that you created in previous step.\
This will store your environment variables in the following format
```
KEY=value
ANOTHER_KEY=some other value
```

> Open the file ***dev.env*** and add to it the following content:

```
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=thisismysecret
OMDB_API_KEY=da9569d1
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/movie-app-api
```

  * *PORT* - port which you want to use
  * *JWT_SECRET* - secret phrase that the jwt token is created with, used in authentication
  * *OMDB_API_KEY* - API key used to acces **OMDb API**. If the above code doesnâ€™t work you can generate your own on OMDb API website,
instructions [here](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
  * *MONGODB_URL* - connection string to database

> Now, everything is set up. In project directory, you can run:
```
npm run dev
```

Or

```
npm run withNodemon
```
